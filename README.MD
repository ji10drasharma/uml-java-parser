# UML to LeJOS Code Generator

Welcome to the `uml2lejos.py` project! This tool allows you to generate Java code from UML state charts.

## Overview

`uml2lejos.py` is the main script that facilitates the conversion of UML state chart JSON files into Java code. This is particularly useful for robotics programming with the LeJOS platform.

## Input Files

The program takes JSON files as input. Examples of such files are `Task1.mdj` and `Task2.mdj`.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python uml2lejos.py <path_to_statechart_JSON_file> <path_for_output_java_code>
